    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Moview is a global social network for grass-roots film discussion and discovery.
    Use it as a diary to record and share your opinion about films as you watch them, or just
    to keep track of films you’ve seen in the past.
    Showcase your favorites on your profile page. Rate, review and tag films as you add them.
    Find and follow your friends to see what they’re enjoying. Keep a watchlist of films you’d like to
    see, and create lists/collections on any given topic. We’ve been described as “like GoodReads for movies”.

We have apps for iOS, Android and Apple TV. Paying members get an ad-free experience, personalized
all-time and annual stats pages, the option to select and filter by what’s available on their favorite
streaming services, watchlist notifications, the ability to filter activity streams by entry type and to
 clone other members’ lists, and much more. Learn about Pro.</p>
